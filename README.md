This is a project for DSC 80 at UCSD

**Name(s)**: Haoyang Yu, Jessie Zhang

 
### Introduction
The primary objective is to investigate the relationship between severe weather events and power outages. Specifically, the research aims to discern whether severe weather conditions contribute to a higher incidence of power outages compared to other causative factors over the years.

Our dataset encompasses records of significant power outages observed across various states in the continental U.S. during January 2000â€“July 2016, comprising 1534 entries and 55 variables. To enhance the analytical focus on power outage research, a decision has been made to streamline the dataset by retaining only 10 pertinent columns. 

Columns include the following:
- **'POSTAL.CODE'**: Represents the postal code of the U.S. states
- **'OUTAGE.START.DATE'**: This variable indicates the day of the year when the outage event started (as reported by the corresponding Utility in the region)
- **'OUTAGE.START.TIME'**: This variable indicates the time of the day when the outage event started (as reported by the corresponding Utility in the region)
- **'OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE'**: This variable indicates the day of the year when power was restored to all the customers (as reported by the corresponding Utility in the region)
- **'OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME'**: This variable indicates the time of the day when power was restored to all the customers (as reported by the corresponding Utility in the region)
- **'CAUSE.CATEGORY'**: Categories of all the events causing the major power outages
- **'CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL'**: Detailed description of the event categories causing the major power outages
- **'OUTAGE.DURATION'**: Duration of outage events (in minutes)
- **'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED'**: Number of customers affected by the power outage event
- **'TOTAL.PRICE'**: Average monthly electricity price in the U.S. state (cents/kilowatt-hour)

This choropleth map below visualizes the total number of power outages for each state in the United States from 2000 to 2016. The darker the color, the higher the number of outages that occurred in that state during this 16-year period. 
- For Alaska, where no outage duration information is available, it appears in grey instead of the color map.

### Cleaning and EDA
#### Step 1: Data Cleaning
**Step 1.1**: 
   1. Combine power outage start date and time
   2. Combine power restoration date and time

After step 1.1, we have 1534 rows and 8 columns. 
Part of our data frame: (Only top 5 rows)

|    | POSTAL.CODE   | CAUSE.CATEGORY     | CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL   |   OUTAGE.DURATION |   CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED |   TOTAL.PRICE | OUTAGE.START        | OUTAGE.RESTORATION   |
|---:|:--------------|:-------------------|:------------------------|------------------:|---------------------:|--------------:|:--------------------|:---------------------|
|  1 | MN            | severe weather     | nan                     |              3060 |                70000 |          9.28 | 2011-07-01 17:00:00 | 2011-07-03 20:00:00  |
|  2 | MN            | intentional attack | vandalism               |                 1 |                  nan |          9.28 | 2014-05-11 18:38:00 | 2014-05-11 18:39:00  |
|  3 | MN            | severe weather     | heavy wind              |              3000 |                70000 |          8.15 | 2010-10-26 20:00:00 | 2010-10-28 22:00:00  |
|  4 | MN            | severe weather     | thunderstorm            |              2550 |                68200 |          9.19 | 2012-06-19 04:30:00 | 2012-06-20 23:00:00  |
|  5 | MN            | severe weather     | nan                     |              1740 |               250000 |         10.43 | 2015-07-18 02:00:00 | 2015-07-19 07:00:00  |


**Step 1.2**:
   1. Change column "POSTAL.CODE" to "STATE" to be more readble.
   2. Clean the data of column 'OUTAGE.DURATION'.
   3. Create new column 'YEAR' as integer.

After step 1.2, we have 1398 rows and 9 columns. 
Part of our data frame: (Only top 5 rows)

|    | STATES   | CAUSE.CATEGORY     | CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL   |   OUTAGE.DURATION |   CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED |   TOTAL.PRICE | OUTAGE.START        | OUTAGE.RESTORATION   |   YEAR |
|---:|:---------|:-------------------|:------------------------|------------------:|---------------------:|--------------:|:--------------------|:---------------------|-------:|

#### Step 2: Univariate Analysis
**Step 2.1**:
The first graph we draw is a bar chart that counts the times of major outages each year. It helps us realize which year often has major outages. It displays the distribution of a outages's happened years.

**Step 2.2**: 
The second graph we draw is still a bar chart, it counts the times of major outages that causes by severe weather of each year. It also displays the distribution of a outages's happened years.

#### Step 3: Bivariate Analysis
During the process of identify possible associations:

**Step 3.1**: 
The first graph we draw is a line graph which contains two lines. First line counts the major outages that caused by severe weather over year and the second line is counts the major outages for all causes. It shows the dirstribution between outages causes reasons and year. 
<iframe src="assets/3_1.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

**Step 3.2**: The second we draw is also a line graph. First line counts the major outages that caused by severe weather over year and the second line is counts the major outages for all causes. It shows the dirstribution between outages causes reasons and year.

#### Step 4: Interesting Aggregates

We choose to group CAUSE.CATEGORY column and index of each year to create the pivot table. It helps us to realize the amount of power outages different between each caused reasons.

### Assessment of Missingness
#### NMAR Analysis
We posit that there exists a NMAR relationship between the data in the CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED and TOTAL.PRICE columns. Given that power outages attributable to factors such as severe weather and various other causes, the customer affected population will be various, the TOTAL.PRICE is unlikely to exert a direct influence on the CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED variable.
However, the influence on the CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED variable may be discerned through the temporal aspect captured by the OUTAGE.DURATION column. It is conceivable that an extended outage duration could result in a higher number of affected customers, thereby introducing a missing at random (MAR) pattern in the CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED column.

#### Step 5: Missingness Dependency
**Step 5.1**:
- **Null Hypothesis**: Values in the 'TOTAL.PRICE' column for rows where the 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED' was missing were drawn from the same distribution as the values in rows where 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED' was not missing.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: They were drawn from different distributions.
- **Significance level**: 0.05

<iframe src="assets/5_2_3.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The p-value is approximately 0.85 , which is higher than our significance level. We fail to reject the null hypothesis, the missing data from CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED are not depends on TOTAL.PRICE.
`
**Step 5.2**:
- **Null Hypothesis**: Values in the 'OUTAGE.DURATION' column for rows where the 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED' was missing were drawn from the same distribution as the values in rows where 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED' was not missing.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: They were drawn from different distributions.
- **Significance level**: 0.05

<iframe src="assets/5_1_3.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The p-value is approximately 0.011, which is lower than our significance level. We reject the null hypothesis. The missing data from CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED are depends on OUTAGE.DURATION.

### Hypothesis Testing
#### Severe Weather V.S. All Causes
The question we are trying to answer is whether severe weather conditions contribute to a higher incidence of power outages compared to other causative factors over the years. We already have the data of each years power outages, so we can draw the data several times from the probabilities for each year


- **Null Hypothesis**: Outages that caused by severe weather **were** drawn at random from all power outage.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: Outages that caused by severe weather **were not** drawn at random from all power outage.
- **Observation**: Outages per Year Distribution of Severe Weather.
- **significance level**: 0.05
<iframe src="assets/hyp_1.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

We use the TVD to compute the observed data between Severe Weather outage distribution and All Causes's outage distribution, which is 0.14467457848980325.


#### The plan


To conduct our hypothesis test, we will:
- Repeatedly generate samples of size 1398 (number of power outages) from the outages per Year distribution of all causes.
- Each time, compute the TVD between the simulated distribution and all causes's distribution.
- **This will generate an empirical distribution of TVDs, under the null.**
- Finally, determine whether the observed TVD is consistent with the empirical distribution of TVDs.

<iframe src="assets/hyp.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

### Conclusion
- The chance that the observed TVD came from the distribution of TVDs under the null is essentially 0.
- Based on our testing, the severe weather conditions tend to contribute to a higher incidence of power outages compared to other causative factors over the years. The difference can't be explained solely due to chance.
